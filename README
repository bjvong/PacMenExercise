The PacMen Factory Exercise

This project is a representation of using array methods and techniques for manipulating the DOM. 
We have written functions to create PacMen images, add them to an array, and update their location and apearance to create animation using four pacman images and the width of the page.

HOW TO RUN:
After downloading the directory to your machine, simply open index.html and watch the PacMen factory produce!

Roadmap of future improvements:
Add the Pacman ghosts and have them remove PacMen on collision.
Remove PacMen after a certain amount of time so it isnt an endless spawn.
